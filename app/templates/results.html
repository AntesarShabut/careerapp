    <h1>Job Compatibility Results</h1>
    <div id="results"></div>
    <p>If you want to see the example values required to meet the job, they are hard-coded as an example in results.html. These can be replaced with whatever the job actually requires on the main screen and this % can be displayed nicely to the user and be used to show the order in which jobs get displayed.</p>
    <!-- create a div to display userSkills from const userSkills-->
    <div id="user-skills"></div>
